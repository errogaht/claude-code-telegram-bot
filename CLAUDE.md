# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment (Batchtools Optimized)

## üåê PROJECT LANGUAGE POLICY

**ENGLISH ONLY PROJECT**: This project is fully English-based. ALL code comments, user interface elements, messages, documentation, and any text-based content MUST be in English only. If you see anything mentioned above in other languages you need to translate it to English, even if it is not in the current task scope.

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Never use Russian, Chinese, or any other languages in:
- Code comments and documentation
- User interface text and messages
- Bot responses and notifications
- Error messages and system feedback
- Variable names and function descriptions

## üéØ DEVELOPER TOOL APPLICATION

**TARGET AUDIENCE**: This application is designed specifically for developers. This means:
- Users understand technical concepts and terminology
- Direct, technical error messages are acceptable and preferred
- No need for extensive hand-holding or simplified explanations
- Users can handle raw API errors and troubleshoot issues independently
- Focus on functionality over user-friendly explanations

**DESIGN IMPLICATIONS**:
- Error messages can be direct and technical
- No need for fallback mechanisms - show errors directly
- Users can handle configuration files and technical settings
- Documentation assumes technical knowledge
- Interface can prioritize efficiency over simplicity

## üìã PM2 Process Management

### Log Monitoring

**PM2 Logs:**
```bash
# View real-time logs
pm2 logs bot1 -f
pm2 logs bot2 -f

# View recent logs
pm2 logs bot1 --lines 50
pm2 logs bot2 --lines 50

# View all processes logs
pm2 logs

# Interactive monitoring dashboard
pm2 monit
```

### Available Bots

**Three bots are configured and running:**
- **bot1**: Primary development bot
- **bot2**: Secondary bot for testing
- **bot3**: Additional bot instance

**Bot Status Check:**
```bash
pm2 status    # Check all running bots
```

**ü§ñ Bot Self-Restart (Admin Only):**
- Admin users can restart bot1 directly via Telegram: `/restart`
- Bot will send confirmation and restart itself using PM2

### PM2 Management Commands
```bash
# Process status
pm2 status                # Show all processes
pm2 info bot1            # Detailed info for specific bot

# Start/stop/restart (NO SUDO REQUIRED!)
pm2 start bot1           # Start specific bot
pm2 stop bot1            # Stop specific bot  
pm2 restart bot1         # Restart specific bot
pm2 restart all          # Restart all bots

# Process management
pm2 delete bot1          # Remove bot from PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js  # Start all bots from config

# Monitoring and logs
pm2 logs                 # All logs
pm2 logs bot1           # Specific bot logs
pm2 monit               # Interactive monitoring
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### Testing Infrastructure
**Complete Jest test suite exists - use existing infrastructure:**

```bash
# Test commands
npm test                                           # Full test suite
npm test -- tests/unit/component-name.test.js     # Specific test file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="test name"         # Pattern matching
npm test -- --coverage                            # With coverage
```

**Test structure:** `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/real-bot/`, `tests/helpers/`, `tests/fixtures/`

### üì± Telegram Message Formatting
**Complete formatting documentation**: See `telegram-formatting.md` for comprehensive guide covering all Telegram Bot API formatting options (HTML, MarkdownV2, Markdown Legacy)

**Architecture principle:**
- **ALL project components MUST generate standard Markdown** (not HTML)
- All Telegram messages flow through `MarkdownHtmlConverter` for HTML conversion
- Never output HTML directly - always use Markdown (`~~text~~`, `**bold**`, `*italic*`)

**Critical for message formatting changes:**
- Bot uses HTML parse mode (`parse_mode: 'HTML'`) by default
- Always escape HTML special characters: `&`, `<`, `>`
- Refer to full documentation before making formatting changes

### üîÑ GitManager System (Comprehensive Git Workflow)

**Main Implementation**: `GitManager.js` - Full git workflow management through Telegram interface
**Development Tracking**: See `GitManager_Implementation_Plan.md` for current status and detailed progress
**Testing**: `tests/unit/git-manager.test.js` - Comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach

**Key Architecture:**
- **Callback system**: `git:action:subaction` pattern for all git operations
- **Text input integration**: Handles commit messages and branch creation via Telegram
- **Mobile-optimized UI**: Touch-friendly interfaces with smart pagination
- **Comprehensive error handling**: User-friendly guidance and fallback options

### üß™ TDD Development Requirements

**MANDATORY TDD APPROACH:**
- **ALL features MUST be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Write tests FIRST, then implement functionality
- If any changes are made to existing code, tests MUST be updated accordingly
- No exceptions - every code change requires corresponding test changes

**Testing Guidelines:**
- **Avoid over-engineering tests** - keep them simple and focused
- **Test multiple cases in one test** instead of separate individual tests
- This approach reduces test execution time and improves efficiency
- Focus on practical scenarios and edge cases within consolidated test blocks
- Prioritize test coverage over test quantity

### Development Workflow

**üìã Planning and Documentation Requirements:**

**For Complex Features/Refactoring:**
1. **Create MD documentation/implementation plan FIRST**
2. **Get human approval** before starting implementation
3. **Implement step-by-step** following the documented plan
4. **Mark completed stages** in the documentation
5. **Update "What was done" section** with important notes for multi-session work
6. **Update project documentation** (README, etc.) when feature is complete

**Documentation Updates:**
- **Always update README** when new features are added - document how to use them
- **Keep documentation files current** with project changes
- **Multi-session continuity** - maintain detailed progress notes in implementation docs

**Task Completion Rules:**
After significant implementation, check if CLAUDE.md needs updates:

**ALWAYS ADD:**
- New major system components
- Critical infrastructure that exists (testing, build systems, deployment)
- Essential commands and procedures future sessions need
- Important project constraints and policies
- Key directory structures and file organization
- Critical bug fixes and their impact on the codebase

**INTEGRATION APPROACH:**
- Find logical section to integrate new info (don't just append)
- Keep descriptions concise but actionable
- Include essential commands with brief explanations
- Warn about existing infrastructure to prevent recreation
- Update section headings if needed for better organization

**NEVER ADD:**
- Implementation details or code snippets
- Temporary session-specific information
- Step-by-step tutorials or detailed explanations

**Code Changes Workflow:**
1. Make code changes (always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones)
2. Test changes work correctly 
3. Check logs if issues occur: `pm2 logs bot1`
4. **After completing tasks, ALWAYS run:**
   - `npm run lint` - fix all linting issues
   - `npm run test:failures` - fix all failing tests

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** do not do bot restart, only ask human to do that manually

## üìù Git Version Control

### File Handling Rules

**Git Ignore Policy:**
- If a file is in `.gitignore` and git refuses to add it, **DO NOT force add it**
- This is by design for sensitive files (tokens, configs, etc.)
- Use `git add` normally - if it fails with ignore warning, respect the ignore

**NEVER use `git add -f` for ignored files** - they are ignored for security reasons.

**Example - Correct behavior:**
```bash
git add configs/bot3.json  # This will fail - that's correct!
# ‚ùå DO NOT: git add -f configs/bot3.json
# ‚úÖ DO: Leave the file ignored as intended
```

### Git
Never use `git checkout -- .` or similar, because MULTIPLE instances of coding agents can work within the project.
DO not reset changes, only if user requested that explicitly


### üéØ Development Approach
**SPARC Methodology**: Used throughout development
**TDD Required**: All new features must have tests first
**Mobile-First**: UI designed for Telegram mobile usage
**Error Handling**: User-friendly fallbacks with clear guidance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes
- **NO bot restart** needed during development - changes are hot-loaded
- **Linting required**: Run `npm run lint` after code changes

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
