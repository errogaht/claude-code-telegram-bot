# Telegram Bot API Research Report for Claude Code Terminal Control System

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report analyzes the technical feasibility of creating a Telegram bot system for remote Claude Code terminal control on Ubuntu 25. The research covers Telegram Bot API capabilities, terminal control libraries, security considerations, and multi-instance architecture requirements.

**Key Finding**: The proposed system is technically feasible with proven open-source solutions available for implementation.

## 1. Telegram Bot API Capabilities Analysis

### 1.1 Real-Time Message Streaming

**Supported Methods:**
- **Webhooks**: Real-time push mechanism where Telegram sends updates via HTTPS POST requests
- **Long Polling**: getUpdates method for continuous polling (up to 100 updates per request)
- **WebSocket Alternative**: No native WebSocket support, but webhooks provide equivalent real-time capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Updates are stored for up to 24 hours if not retrieved
- Supports streaming parameters (supports_streaming) for video content
- Maximum webhook connections: 100,000 concurrent connections

### 1.2 Rate Limiting Rules & Best Practices

**Critical Limits:**
- Individual chats: Maximum 1 message per second (short bursts allowed)
- Groups: Maximum 20 messages per minute
- Bulk notifications: ~30 users per second maximum
- File operations: 20MB download limit, 50MB upload limit (2GB with custom Bot API server)

**Best Practices:**
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
- Spread notifications over 8-12 hour intervals
- Use retry logic with proper error handling
- Monitor rate limit headers and implement queuing

### 1.3 Inline Keyboard Permission System

**Implementation Capabilities:**
- **Callback Buttons**: Execute actions without sending messages to chat
- **URL Buttons**: External link integration
- **Web App Buttons**: Launch interactive web applications
- **Login URL Buttons**: OAuth 2.0 authentication integration

**Security Features:**
- SRP 2FA payload support for enhanced authentication
- Location permission requests for geo-based features
- Callback data encryption and validation
- User authorization with requires_password flag

### 1.4 File Upload/Download Capabilities

**Standard Limits:**
- Download: 20MB files via Bot API
- Upload: 50MB files standard, 2GB with custom server
- File retention: Download links valid for minimum 1 hour

**Advanced Solutions:**
- Multi-client streaming for larger files
- Direct streaming links without temporary storage
- Chunked upload/download for large logs
- File forwarding through dummy channels for streaming

### 1.5 Voice Message Processing Integration

**Native Support:**
- Transcription API with pending/completed status tracking
- updateTranscribedAudio events for real-time updates
- Multiple language support for accurate transcription

**Integration Options:**
- OpenAI Whisper integration for high-quality transcription
- Google Speech Recognition API for cloud processing
- Offline solutions with Vosk for privacy-sensitive deployments
- Support for multiple audio formats: voice messages, MP3, WAV, MP4, MOV

## 2. Ubuntu 25 Terminal Control Libraries

### 2.1 node-pty (Recommended)

**Features:**
- Cross-platform pseudoterminal support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Node.js 16+ or Electron 19+ compatibility
- Process spawning with full terminal emulation
- Thread-unsafe (single-threaded operation required)

**Ubuntu Dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt install -y make python build-essential
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
var pty = require('node-pty');
var ptyProcess = pty.spawn('bash', [], {
    name: 'xterm-color',
    cols: 80,
    rows: 30,
    cwd: process.env.HOME,
    env: process.env
});
```

### 2.2 Python pty Module

**Features:**
- Built-in Python library for Unix systems
- spawn() function for process terminal control
- Platform-dependent implementation
- Lower-level control compared to node-pty

**Security Note:**
All processes launched inherit parent permissions - container isolation recommended for internet-accessible servers.

### 2.3 xterm.js Integration

**Real-time Streaming Architecture:**
- Frontend: xterm.js terminal emulator
- Backend: WebSocket/Socket.io server
- Terminal: node-pty process spawning

**Key Requirements:**
- Terminal size synchronization (columns Ã— rows must match)
- Proper data flow handling between PTY and frontend
- Echo handling for user input feedback

## 3. Multi-Instance Architecture Design

### 3.1 Session Management Strategies

**Process Isolation:**
- child_process.fork() for isolated worker processes
- PM2 for process management and auto-restart
- Cluster module for load balancing across CPU cores

**Session Storage Solutions:**
- **Redis**: Distributed session storage for scalability
- **MongoDB**: Document-based session management
- **Memory Stores**: Development only (not production-ready)

### 3.2 Inter-Process Communication

**IPC Methods:**
- Node.js cluster IPC for worker coordination
- SharedArrayBuffer for memory sharing (with security considerations)
- Message passing through session stores
- Event-driven architecture with pub/sub patterns

**Scaling Patterns:**
- Horizontal scaling with shared session storage
- Load balancing with sticky sessions
- Process pooling for resource optimization

## 4. Security Assessment

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization

**Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- SSH key-based authentication (RSA 4096-bit minimum)
- Two-factor authentication with TOTP (Google Authenticator)
- Telegram user ID verification
- Session token validation

**Access Control:**
- IP whitelisting for bot access
- Role-based permissions system
- Command authorization matrix
- Audit logging for all operations

### 4.2 Network Security

**Encryption Requirements:**
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
- SSH tunneling for terminal sessions
- VPN integration for additional security layer
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive commands

**Firewall Configuration:**
- Non-standard port usage (avoid default 22, 3389)
- Fail2Ban for brute force protection
- Rate limiting at network level
- Geographic access restrictions

### 4.3 System Hardening

**Process Security:**
- Container isolation (Docker/Podman recommended)
