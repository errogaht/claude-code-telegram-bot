**# GitManager Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Transform the current `GitDiffManager` into a comprehensive `GitManager` that provides full git workflow management through Telegram bot interface.

## ✅ **Task Tracking System**

**IMPORTANT**: When implementing this plan, mark tasks as completed directly in this document to track progress.

**Marking Convention**:
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Task fully implemented and tested
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Task currently being worked on  
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Task blocked by dependency or issue
- ⏳ **PENDING** - Task not yet started

**Example Usage**:
```
### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)** ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Rename GitDiffManager → GitManager
2. 🔄 Update all references and callbacks  
3. ⏳ Implement basic branch detection and display
4. ❌ Enhance git overview with branch info (blocked by callback updates)
```

**Progress Tracking**: Update status immediately after completing each task or encountering blockers. This ensures clear visibility of implementation progress and identifies bottlenecks early.

## 📋 **Current State Analysis**

### **Existing GitDiffManager Capabilities:**
- ✅ Git repository detection
- ✅ Git status and diff viewing
- ✅ File change overview and pagination
- ✅ Individual file diff viewing with context control
- ✅ Untracked file content display
- ✅ Mobile-friendly pagination and navigation

### **Current Methods to Preserve:**
- `checkGitRepository()` - Repository validation

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### **Current Testing Issues Analysis**

**Existing GitDiffManager Test Problems:**
- ❌ **Mock-only testing**: Uses mocked git commands, doesn't verify real operations
- ❌ **File name truncation bug**: Tests show first character truncation issues (lines 133, 387, 196, 537)
- ❌ **No real file system validation**: Cannot catch issues where interface shows non-existent files
- ❌ **No git state verification**: Cannot verify actual git repository state changes

### **New Testing Architecture**

#### **1. Real Git Integration Testing Principles** (`tests/integration/git-manager-real.test.js`)

**Purpose**: Test all GitManager operations with actual git repositories and file systems.

**Testing Infrastructure Approach**:
- **Temporary Repository Management**: Create isolated git repositories for each test with automatic cleanup
- **Real Git Operations**: Execute actual git commands and validate both command output and file system state
- **File System Validation**: Ensure all displayed files actually exist on disk to prevent UI/reality mismatches
- **State Verification**: Cross-validate UI state against actual git repository state after each operation

**Branch Operations Testing**:
- **Creation & Switching**: Verify branches are created in real repository and UI reflects current branch
- **Listing & Status**: Test branch discovery with proper ahead/behind tracking information
- **Edge Cases**: Handle invalid branch names, non-existent branches, and checkout conflicts

**Staging Operations Testing**:
- **Individual File Control**: Test single-file staging/unstaging with real git add/reset commands
- **Bulk Operations**: Verify stage-all and unstage-all affect correct file sets
- **Special Characters**: Handle files with spaces, Unicode characters, and shell-sensitive names
- **State Consistency**: Ensure staging UI matches actual git index state

**Commit Operations Testing**:
- **Message Validation**: Test length limits, empty messages, and special character handling
- **History Verification**: Confirm commits appear in git log with correct messages and file changes
- **Working Directory**: Verify clean state after successful commits

**File System Validation Testing**:
- **Existence Checks**: All UI-displayed files must exist on disk and be readable
- **Deletion Handling**: Test scenarios where files are deleted outside git (manual deletion)
- **Permission Issues**: Handle files that become unreadable or directories that become inaccessible

#### **2. Enhanced Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/git-manager.test.js`)

**Migrated from GitDiffManager with fixes:**
- ✅ **Fixed filename truncation tests**: Remove workarounds for first character bugs
- ✅ **Real command validation**: Verify actual git commands are constructed correctly
- ✅ **Enhanced mocking**: More realistic git command outputs
- ✅ **Edge case coverage**: Handle all git status codes and file states

#### **3. Telegram Bot Integration Testing Principles** (`tests/real-bot/git-manager-workflows.test.js`)

**Complete workflow testing through Telegram interface:**

**End-to-End Workflow Testing**:
- **Complete Git Workflows**: Test full stage→commit→push sequences through actual Telegram bot interface
- **Navigation Patterns**: Verify button presses navigate correctly between git overview, staging, branches, and commit interfaces
- **State Persistence**: Ensure git state remains consistent across UI navigation and operations
- **Real Repository Integration**: Cross-validate Telegram UI state with actual git repository state at each step

**User Interaction Simulation**:
- **Button Press Testing**: Simulate actual Telegram callback button presses with proper callback data
- **Text Input Handling**: Test commit message input and branch name input through Telegram's text input system
- **Multi-Step Operations**: Validate operations that require multiple user interactions (commit workflow, branch creation)

**Workflow Validation Approach**:
- **Stage Management**: Test individual file staging, bulk operations, and UI state updates
- **Branch Operations**: Verify branch switching, creation, and status display accuracy
- **Commit Process**: Test complete commit workflow from staging through message input to final commit
- **Error Scenarios**: Handle invalid operations and network issues gracefully through Telegram interface

#### **4. Performance & Load Testing Principles** (`tests/performance/git-manager-performance.test.js`)

**Performance Validation Approach**:
- **Large Repository Handling**: Test git operations with repositories containing hundreds of files and commits
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Ensure all operations complete within acceptable time limits (≤5 seconds for status, ≤2 seconds for simple operations)
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: Monitor memory consumption during large repository operations
- **Concurrent Operation Handling**: Test rapid user interactions and prevent race conditions

**Load Testing Strategy**:
- **Rapid Interaction Simulation**: Test quick successive button presses and command executions
- **Large File Handling**: Validate performance with large files and extensive diffs
- **Branch-Heavy Repositories**: Test performance with repositories containing many branches
- **Network Operation Timeouts**: Ensure remote operations (push/pull/fetch) handle network delays appropriately

### **Testing Implementation Strategy**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Testing (Week 1)**
1. **Setup testing infrastructure** with temporary git repositories
2. **Migrate existing tests** from GitDiffManager to GitManager
3. **Fix filename truncation test cases** that were working around bugs
4. **Add real git repository validation** to all tests

#### **Phase 2: Feature Testing (Week 2-3)**
1. **Branch management tests** with real git operations
2. **Staging operation tests** with file system validation
3. **Commit workflow tests** with git history verification
4. **Telegram integration tests** for complete workflows

#### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (Week 3-4)**
1. **Performance testing** with large repositories
2. **Error scenario testing** with corrupted repos and invalid operations
3. **Edge case testing** with special file names and Unicode
4. **Integration testing** with real Telegram Bot API

### **Test Data Management**

#### **Temporary Repository Lifecycle**
**Testing Isolation Strategy**: Each test receives a fresh temporary git repository with automatic cleanup to prevent test interference and ensure consistent starting conditions.

#### **Test File Scenarios**
- **Modified files**: Different content types, line changes, binary files
- **Staged files**: Partially staged, fully staged, mixed staging states
- **Untracked files**: New files, ignored files, nested directories
- **Deleted files**: Removed from working directory, staged deletions
- **Renamed files**: Git detects renames, moves between directories
- **Special files**: Unicode names, spaces, symlinks, executable bits

#### **Git State Validation Approach**
**Cross-Validation Strategy**: Verify git repository state matches UI display by comparing actual git command output with displayed UI state to ensure accuracy and prevent phantom file issues.

### **Continuous Integration Integration**

#### **GitHub Actions Integration Approach**
**Continuous Integration Strategy**: Implement automated testing pipeline that runs all test categories on push and pull requests, ensuring comprehensive validation before code integration.

#### **Test Categories Structure**
**Organized Test Execution**: Create separate npm scripts for different test types (unit, integration, real-bot, performance) to enable targeted testing during development and comprehensive testing during CI.

### **Quality Metrics & Coverage**

#### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: 95%+ line coverage, 90%+ branch coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 100% git command coverage, 100% file operation coverage
- **Telegram Tests**: 100% callback handler coverage, 100% workflow coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Response time validation, memory usage monitoring

#### **Quality Gates Standards**
**Testing Criteria**: All tests must meet defined quality thresholds including coverage percentages, response time limits, memory usage constraints, and file system validation requirements to ensure production readiness.
